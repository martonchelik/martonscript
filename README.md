A set of scripts to speed up the work with admin panel. Currently, the following main scripts are available:

- Duplicate panel at the top: In the player's profile, a duplicate panel is placed at the top. If duplicate-account is not blocked or there is no comment with the duplicate's email in the profile, it is marked in red; otherwise, it is marked in green.

- Templates for cancellations, comments, and document rejections: When canceling, commenting, or rejecting documents, clicking on the text field will open a list of templates with the options to select. When typing text in the text field,
a search will be performed to match the entered text with the templates. When selecting one of the templates, "Under review" + the reason for sending to review, only the text "Under review" text is inserted into the comment, then the player's profile
link and the reason for sending to review will be copied to the clipboard. Also there is a subfunction that adds a "No cashout" tag to the player if the reason of sending to a review demands so.

- Player Information: In the documents panel, duplicate information about the player is displayed (name, surname, email, date of birth, whether the phone and email are verified). If the birth year is 2000 or later, the date of birth is marked in red.

- Payment Methods: Highlights unverified cards and indicates if the deposit or cashout limit without verification has been exhausted.

- Additional Buttons When Viewing a Document: Adds the ability to edit player information without leaving the player's document view. When clicking the "Edit" button at the bottom of the screen while viewing a player's documents, a separate
window will open for editing the player's information. It automatically closes after the player's data is updated. It also adds a "Comment" button, which opens a comment input field for the document being viewed when clicked.

- Automatic Commission Checkbox: Automatically checks the commission box if the deposit has not been wagered in both the main payment information and on the side, as well as if there is a commission agreement and the player is not a gambling addict.

- Streamer Payment Information: Adds a button to player payments with the tag "streamer_payment_approval" that, when clicked, copies the project, player's email, withdrawal amount, payment system (if withdrawing to crypto), and whether the deposit has
been wagered. There is an additional setting that automatically leaves the comment "Under approval" when this button is clicked.

- Automatic Clicking of the "Process Payment" Button Upon Entering the 2FA Code

- Betting Odds: Adds odds in the casino betting pages. Highlights in red: roulette x2, x3, x4, instant games from x1 to x1.4, any bets x1000. Highlights in yellow: bets on the entire (+-10%) balance in roulette,
bets from x1 to x1.3 in roulette, bets on the entire (+-20%) balance in baccarat, bets x1 in baccarat. The instant game database is incomplete and can be expanded by clicking "Add Games" below and adding the game name to the list.

And a bunch of other smaller scripts and features. Each function has detailed descriptions that can be seen by hovering over the "i" button next to the function name.
